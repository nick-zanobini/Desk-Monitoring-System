#Creating a desk monitoring system.

Components:
  * Raspberry Pi 3
  * 8GB MicroSD Card
  * 5V 2.1A Switching Power Supply
  * Raspberry Pi Camera
  * QLight ST-USB Series Signal Tower

First thing I did was connect the camera to the Raspberry Pi and the case on both my Raspberry Pi and the camera module.
Next I flashed my SD card with the latest version of Raspian Jesse. Then I got to work installing all the necessary libraries.
